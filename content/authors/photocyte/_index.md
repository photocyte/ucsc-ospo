Tim is an NIH F32 postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Brad Moore at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California, San Diego. Tim works at the interface of specialized metabolic pathway discovery, laboratory automation, and the development of scientific infrastructure. His postdoctoral research has been applying lab automation to enable the study of genes responsible for toxin production in haptophyte microalgae. He is a member of the Laboratory Open Protocol (LabOP) Language project (https://bioprotocols.github.io/labop/), developing an open community software standard to represent laboratory protocols in a format understandable by both bench scientists and machines. Tim completed his PhD in Biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying the specialized metabolism of fireflies in the laboratory of Jing-Ke Weng
